# Getting Started
This solution is made up of 2 projects:
1. Security Analyzer
2. Security Analyzer Graph

Both of these projects were built using .NET 6. It is recommended to use Visual Studio instead of Visual Studio Code. 

## Security Analyzer
You can specify what repositories and CVE's to look at by updating the **specs.json** file in the Specs folder. Report output is generated in a folder called **Reports**. If the folder doesn't exist the application, it will create it. The path to read the **specs.json** can be defined in the **appsettings.json** file. **The absolute path should be used**. In order for this program to work, the **Security Analyzer API should already be running**. You must specify the URL on where that API is running. If running locally, you can specify localhost and the port number. For example: `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Security Analyzer Graph
You can update the application settings in **appsettings.json**. Several GraphTypes can be defined:
- DaysResolved
- MostAffectedRepo
- RepoWithMostCves
- MostAffectiveCve 

You must define the **ReportPath** which is where the JSON output generated by the Security Analyzer is read. The path can be from anywhere. Make sure to use the absolue path.
